# TimeDisplay
An app example that displays your current time with real time updates.

***Please keep in mind, that only your time and date are in real time. Los Angles, Chicago, and New York are in real time 
based on those who live in Phoenix's time zone. There are no API downloads in this, just an example of how it would be coded and displayed.***

## What I Learned
* Incorporating 'Date()' to find the user's current exact time & date  
* Configuring date layouts for specific formats  
* Adding time intervals to allow for constant time updates
